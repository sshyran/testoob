h2. Should I Bother?

Please, if you have a feature you need or would like, request it! We will be
indebted. Remember that our "motivation":motivation.html is to make writing
tests a happy and productive process. :-)

h2. Guidelines for Submission

Please fill the short summary and full description, don't worry about the rest
of the fields.

If you also enter your email address we will be able to get back to you if we
have questions.

We encourage you to check out the
"active tickets":https://opensvn.csie.org/traccgi/testoob/trac.cgi/report/1
before you submit - your feature or bug may already be there, with helpful
comments. In this case, it would be better to add a comment to the existing
ticket.
