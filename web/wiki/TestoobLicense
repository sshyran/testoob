TestOOB is released under the [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.html GNU LGPL], which means it is free for use with any project with no restrictions.

If you distribute TestOOB by itself or as part of an application you must include the sources for TestOOB, as well as the copyright and licensing information distributed with TestOOB.

If you distribute a modified version of TestOOB, you are required to comply with the LGPL's distribution rules.

Note that this applies only to work that is ''derived from'' TestOOB. Work that ''uses'' TestOOB is, as stated above, under no restriction.

Note also that internal use solely within an organization is not considered distribution by the GNU licenses, and so doesn't fall under the LGPL's distribution rules. See the [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#TOCInternalDistribution GNU GPL FAQ] for more info.
