h2. A note on submitting patches

To prevent licensing woes in the future, we request that patches be released
under the "Apache License, Version 2.0":http://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php . This will allow us to re-release
TestOOB under a different license in the future, for example one that can "be
contributed":http://www.python.org/psf/contrib.html to the Python Software Foundation, if TestOOB is ever considered
for inclusion as a standard Python module.
