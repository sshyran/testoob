#summary Working with Testoob's source control.

= Bazaar =
Testoob is being developed with Bazaar, hosted on launchpad: http://launchpad.net/testoob

= Subversion mirror =
We maintain a read-only subversion mirror on the Google Code svn server: http://testoob.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

= Getting Started =
Quick guide. Also check out [http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr.dev/en/mini-tutorial/index.html this 5-minute tutorial].
 1. Create a user on [https://launchpad.net Launchpad]
 1. Create a SSH keypair
   * Upload the public key to Launchpad ("change details" in your profile page, look for a  "SSH Keys" submenu)
   * Load your private key with ssh-agent on `*`nix or [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html Pageant] on Windows.
 1. Install Bazaar (from [https://launchpad.net/bzr/+download here] or your system's package management system)
 1. Run the following (I don't use my real email, you can decide for yourself):
{{{
bzr whoami "John Doe <john@example.com>"
}}}
 1. Create a shared repository (helps with cheap branching later):
{{{
bzr init-repo --1.9-rich-root testoob
}}}
 1. Get the trunk:
{{{
cd testoob
bzr branch lp:testoob trunk
}}}

= Working on features =
 * Create a local branch and work on it there:
{{{
cd testoob
bzr branch trunk myfeature
cd myfeature
# work here
}}}
 * Occasionally, merge the latest changes from trunk:
{{{
cd ../trunk
bzr pull
cd ../myfeature
bzr pull ../trunk
}}}
 * When you want to share, push to a private branch or personal branch on Launchpad - see links below. Notify on the mailing list so everyone knows to take a look.

= Getting the source =
To get Testoob's latest trunk:
{{{
bzr branch lp:testoob
}}}

To update your local branch:
{{{
bzr pull
}}}

= Contributing =
If you're part of the Testoob team:
 * Push to a private branch: see the [https://help.launchpad.net/Code/UploadingABranch Launchpad docs]
 * Push to trunk:
{{{
bzr push lp:testoob
}}}

Bazaar makes it easy to contribute regardless of "commit access". Your name stays on the commits.
 * You can push to a [https://help.launchpad.net/Code/PersonalBranches personal branch] on Launchpad and let us know (we can pull the changes from there)
 * You can create a [http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrGivingBack bundle] file and send it:
{{{
bzr bundle -o bundle.patch
}}}
