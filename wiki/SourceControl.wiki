#summary Working with Testoob's source control.

= Bazaar =
Testoob is being developed with Bazaar, hosted on launchpad: http://launchpad.net/testoob

= Subversion mirror =
We maintain a read-only subversion mirror on the Google Code svn server: http://testoob.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

= Installing Bazaar =
Install from [https://launchpad.net/bzr/+download here] or use your system's package management system

= Getting the source =
To get Testoob's latest trunk:
{{{
bzr branch lp:testoob
}}}

To update your local branch:
{{{
bzr pull
}}}

= Contributing =
If you're part of the Testoob team:
 * Push to a private branch: see the [https://help.launchpad.net/Code/UploadingABranch Launchpad docs]
 * Push to trunk:
{{{
bzr push lp:testoob

Bazaar makes it easy to contribute regardless of "commit access". Your name stays on the commits.
 * You can push to a [https://help.launchpad.net/Code/PersonalBranches personal branch] on Launchpad and let us know (we can pull the changes from there)
 * You can create a [http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrGivingBack bundle] file and send it:

}}}
