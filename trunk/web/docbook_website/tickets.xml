    <para>
        Please, if you have a feature you need or would like, request it! We
        will be indebted.  Remember that our <ulink url="motivation.html">motivation</ulink> is to make writing tests
        a happy and productive process. :-)

    <title>Guidelines for Submission</title>
    <para>
        Please fill the short summary and full description, don't worry about
        the rest of the fields.
        If you also enter your email address (can be mangled in human-readable
        form), we will be able to get back to you if we have questions.
    </para>

    <para>
        We encourage you to check out the <ulink
            url="https://opensvn.csie.org/traccgi/testoob/trac.cgi/report/1">active
            tickets</ulink> before you submit - your feature or bug may already
        be there, with helpful comments. In this case, it would be better to
        add a comment to the existing ticket.
