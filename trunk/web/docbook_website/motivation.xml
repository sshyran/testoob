    <para>
        The idea behind TestOOB is providing simple interfaces to testing
        facilities that will make using and writing tests more enjoyable.

        We hope that one day TestOOB will be a base for cross-language testing
        ideas. If you want to port some TestOOB functionality to another language,
        drop us a line.
