h2. Why are we doing this?

The idea behind TestOOB is to provide simple interfaces to testing facilities
that will make using and writing tests more enjoyable.

We hope that one day TestOOB will be a base for cross-language testing ideas.
If you want to port some TestOOB functionality to another language, drop us a
line.
